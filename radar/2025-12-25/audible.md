I have been using [Audible](https://www.audible.de/) for a few years. I decided to put it on hold for now, as I found that I wasn't utilizing it as much as I thought I would.

I have exported my purchase and loaded them into [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/), which I now use as my primary audiobook management solution.
