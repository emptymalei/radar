I ditched Google Nest WiFi and switched to [Ubiquiti UniFi](https://ui.com/) for my home network. 

It took me some time to learn and set up the system, but I am absolutely happy about the switch.

At this moment, I have 

- Switch Lite 8 PoE (EU Version)
- Cloud Gateway Ultra (EU Version)
- Access Point U6 Pro
- Access Point U7 Pro
