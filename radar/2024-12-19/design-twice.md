There are a lot of engineering philosophies out there. Most of them are talking about the destination. The question for people from outside of the software engineering world is: "How do you get there?".

I have found my best practice: Design twice.

Prepare at least two designs for a product or feature, and then compare them. This is a great way to find the best solution.

I found this approach in the book "The philosophy of software design" by John Ousterhout.
