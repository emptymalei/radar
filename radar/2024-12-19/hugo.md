I have built many static websites using Hugo. The main benefits that I am enjoying are:

- speed: Hugo is very fast, even with a large number of pages.
- reliability: I have websites that I wrote almost 10 years ago and they still work perfectly.
- flexibility: Hugo is very flexible and allows me to build a lot of kind of website I want. I event created my online note-taking system with it ([kausalflow/connectome](https://github.com/kausalflow/connectome), [example 1: my data science notes](https://datumorphism.leima.is/), [example 2: neuronstar](https://neuronstar.kausalflow.com/)).
